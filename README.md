# Noordstar Template

This repository is a template for creating Noordstar websites.

The code was originally created because I noticed I had built several functions and guidelines that I personally like to use. To prevent myself from constantly copypasting them into other projects, I have built my own website template.

It is mainly for personal use only, but feel free to get inspired by it - or to use it yourself.


## Examples

If you look through the repository's branches, I have created a few examples to give you (and myself from the future) an idea of how this template can be used to create several websites.
